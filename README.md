# Python example mock server
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/nielstron/python_example_mock_server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/nielstron/python_example_mock_server)

This is a simple example for a python test case with a mock server set up.
It opens a variable port on the local machine so that requests against
an external API can be tested against the mock server.
